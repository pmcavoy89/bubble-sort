# bubble-sort
Small project that demonstrates bubble sort. Check out the walkthrough [here](https://bubble-sort.programmingpat.com) on my site.

## Commands

A list of commands can be found below to run. I give a short description of what each command does.

* `npm start` - runs a sample sort using hardcoded values.
* `npm test` - runs the tests to ensure the list is sorted.
