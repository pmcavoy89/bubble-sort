This page helps you discover everything this project has to offer to you to learn Bubble sort. From walking through the pseudo-code together to running tests, I hope this helps you learn the algorithm a little more deeply.

This page also intends to help communicate my milestones and where I feel they are at currently. Please feel free to ask questions on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pmcavoy89/bubble-sort/issues) page. I'll do my best to respond when I can.
